# Updating
vacs includes a built-in update mechanism that allows you to easily install new versions as they become available.

---

## Update Notification
When a new version of vacs is available, a notification will appear in the top bar of the application. \
The update indicator appears in the top navigation bar, directly below the current version number. \
This informs you that a newer version is ready to be installed.

<img
  src="/img/getting-started/Update1.png"
  alt="Update Available"
  style={{
    width: "80%",
    display: "block",
    margin: "1.5rem auto",
    borderRadius: "8px",
    boxShadow: "0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)"
  }}
/>

## Applying an Update
To update vacs:
- Open the **Settings** by clicking the relevant button in the top right corner.
- Locate the **Update & Restart** Button and click it.

<img
  src="/img/getting-started/Update2.png"
  alt="Start Update Process"
  style={{
    width: "80%",
    display: "block",
    margin: "1.5rem auto",
    borderRadius: "8px",
    boxShadow: "0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)"
  }}
/>

vacs will then automatically:
- download the latest version,
- install the update,
- start the updated application.
