# Audio Settings

The **Audio Settings** allows you to configure input and output devices as well as adjust important volume levels used during operation.

It can be accessed directly from the main Settings page of the vacs application.

The available options are divided into two sections:

- The Volume Controls,
- The Audio Device Configuration.

## Audio Device Configuration

Under the **Devices** section of the **settings page**, you can configure:

- **Audio Backend** (by default `WASPI` for Windows, `ALSA` for Linux and `CoreAudio` for macOS)
- **Headset / Output Device**
- **Microphone / Input Deivce**

### Call Audio

#### Output Volume

The **Output** slider controls the playback volume of incoming vacs calls.

By clicking onto/releasing the square button, a test-sound is played, which can help you in setting the output volume correctly.

#### Input Volume

The **Input** slider controls your microphone transmission level.

A vertical level meter next to the slider displays your live input level:

- Green → Normal operating range
- Yellow → High level
- Red → Clipping (too loud)

Ensure your microphone does not consistently reach the red zone, as this may cause audio distortion.

:::info Input Level Meter Activation
The input level meter can be toggled on and off by clicking it. By default, it is active (indicated by a blue border) when you open the settings page and should automatically display your audio input.

If you do not see the level meter move as you speak, make sure you have the correct microphone selected and try toggling the meter off and on again to reset it.
