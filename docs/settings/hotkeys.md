# Key Bindings

The **Hotkeys Config** Menu allows you to assign keyboard shortcuts for common actions in vacs. These key bindings are optional, as all relevant actions can also be performed using Touch/Mouse Inputs.

## Opening Hotkeys Config

The **Hotkeys Config** Menu can be accessed from the settings page, by clicking the **Hotkeys** button.

    width: "80%",
    display: "block",
    margin: "1.5rem auto",
    borderRadius: "8px",
    boxShadow: "0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)"
  }}
/>

## Assigning a Key Binding

To bind a key to an action:

- Simply press the field showing **Not bound** or the relevant key binding next to the desired action.
- Press the key (or key combination) you want to assign.
- The field will update to display the selected binding.

  }}
/>

## Available Actions

### Accept first call

This action accepts the first incoming call in the queue. If there are no incoming calls, pressing this keybind has no effect.

### End active call

This action ends the currently active call. If there is no active call, pressing this keybind has no effect.

:::tip Combined call control keybinds
By assigning the same key to both **Accept first call** and **End active call**, you can use a single key to manage your calls: press it once to accept an incoming call, press it again to end the call when you're done coordinating.

If you receive another call while already on one, simply press the key twice to end the current call and accept the new one in one swift motion.
